      <p>Context Coding comes from a source of empathy for those who have no support in the pursuit of their goals to learn a new skill. In multiple workplaces, I've seen talented tradesmen who don't have the time, or interest in taking a moment to help new-comers get started. I see promises of a great on-boarding experience but with no plan in place to make that happen. I have personally been on the receiving end of this issue. The new worker shows up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed with an urge to help solve problems and take note of best practices, but they don't get any time from the pros to give them guidance, and they go home wondering why they ever showed up with a notepad. All the newcomers need is a little snapshot of what "good" looks like. They just need a little nudge in the right direction to unleash their creativity and potential. All they need is a little <code class="logo-brackets">{</code><code class="logo-spread">...</code><code class="logo-letters">Context</code><code class="logo-brackets">}</code> to get started.</p>
